# pancad

pancad is a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) file translator. It is intended to 
enable the sharing of geometry and design information **independent of 
software application**. PanCAD's name is inspired by [Pandoc][1], which is an 
unrelated but similar software application that can convert documents 
from one file type to another.
