"""A module providing a class to represent a part file in CAD. pancad defines a 
part file as a CAD file that contains the geometry definition information for 
one object and potentially different configurations of that object. 

CAD files that contain geometry definition information for multiple objects fall 
out of scope, as well as files that position multiple objects relative to 
each other (e.g. Assemblies).

This file defines what metadata is standard between all part files, though not 
all standard metadata is guaranteed to be filled out. Functions going from and 
to other applications need to map the standard metadata to the client 
application's name for the data (Ex: "identifier" in pancad can map to "PartNo" 
in another application).
